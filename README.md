# üèôÔ∏è New York Airbnb Data Analysis Project
  
This project is all about doing a proper exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings in New York City using Python. I‚Äôve used tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the data and draw useful insights.

## What‚Äôs Inside?

- A step-by-step breakdown of EDA
- Visualizations like price distribution, room type trends, heatmaps, and location-wise plots
- Cleaned and preprocessed data for better readability
- Final insights that summarize the overall scenario of Airbnb in NYC

---

## Key Insights

- Most listings are found in **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**
- **Entire homes/apartments** have higher prices compared to shared or private rooms
- Prices are highly skewed, with some luxury listings pulling the average up
- There‚Äôs a visible cluster of listings in popular boroughs like Midtown, Williamsburg, etc.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## How to Run

Just open the notebook `Airbnb_EDA.ipynb` and run all the cells in order.  
Make sure the dataset `AB_NYC_2019.csv` is in the same folder.

## Why I Did This

I wanted to practice working with real-world datasets and make meaningful stories out of raw data. EDA is the foundation of any data-driven work, and doing this project helped me understand how to break down a problem and explore it visually and logically.
